        <h2>Who is Michael Labuschagne?</h2>
        
        <p>Michael started his real estate career while still studying. He has progressed from an assistant in letting to a letting agent, and later a sales assistant to full title agent. Michael has headed up his own agency and has over 20 years of real estate experience.<br> "Any person who holds themselves out to be an estate agent, is purporting to be a professional in this industry. As such they have a responsibility and an obligation to be educated, informed and sensitive to the current market trends and pricing in their area. I have always strived to extend my knowledge beyond the bare minimum required" -Michael Labuschagne. Armed with knowledge and a professional attitude, complimented with experience, I am able to craft an agreement within the confines of what is leagaly possible and that suits everyone. The posibilites within real estate are vast and seemingly almost never ending. However knowing what the limitations are is as imprtant as knowing what is possible.</p>

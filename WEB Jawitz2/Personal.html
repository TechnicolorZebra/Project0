        <h2>Who is Michael?</h2>
            
            <p>As people we (hopefully) all feel like we exist on an uninterupted continum. We dont see ourselves as single, discreet, moments or seperate roles or people. Yet we are often quick to change hats as we shift from home to work, from informal to professional. In doing so we often box off or seperate different aspects of our behavioural repetiore or parts of oursoelves. We approach situations differently and people differently as the requirements of the situation or the expectation of others demands. <br>
            How often when you listen to people meeting do we hear people define themselves by their jobs? If asked "Tell me more about yourself?", how often do we hear people begin with their jobs, their professions, theri occupations? Sometimes even before their names.<br>
            But we are more than our jobs, our day to day occupation. And when we become segmented sometimes it gets difficult to start and stop the different roles.<br>
            I find to bring myself back to myself. To stand back and get the full picture, that time in the bush, nature, the garden and just away form others gives me the perspective I need.<br>
            Honesty. This is something that is exceptionally important to me. I  have seen so many others where they seem to be getting what they want through less than honest endeavours, but I have realised that the truth always, always, always comes out. Honesty for me is not just not being truthful, but its in the way youconduct yourself, the way you approach an activity or transaction, professional, social, personal or otherwise. I have found myself more than once saying to my child or a colleague, that the only person you can really cheat is yourself. Even if you "get away with it", you will know, someone else will eventually discover and only your belief that you have "got away with it" is actually the deception.

            <h3>Primary Shcool</h3>
            <p>Primary school from Grade 1 to Standard 5 (as it was called then) was completed at Criaghall Primary School, in Craighall Park. <br> Extra murals included cricket, soccer and chess. Having very little skill at cricket this was only briefly played in the early grades, whilst I played soccer until the end of school, albeit for the B side. </p>

            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>Highschool was started and completed at Hyde Park High School (Hyde Fidei Park) - Matriculating in 1992  <br> Extra Murals included, water polo, hockey, lighting and security . <br> It is interesting to note that at the time security was considered important and the team were asked to sweep the school in the early mornings for odd parcels, unattended bags and devices behind hosereels or similar instalations. (I was particulalry tardy in my duties in this regard, but thankfully there were no unhappy incidents at my time at HPHS. The security team were also involved with night time events at the school and were tasked with ensuring nothing odd happened in or about the school during plays, dances or similar occurences. Luckily there were no incidents, because we had no formal training and not really a clue what we would do if we did encunter a situation.
            <br> I really enjoyed waterpolo and through dogged dertermination more than acumen made the 1st Team in my matric year.
                <br> Hockey was not a favourite and I only really played as extramurals were deemed compulsory.
